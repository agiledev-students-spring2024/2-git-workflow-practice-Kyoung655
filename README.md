The article offers a more optimistic view of how AI will impact software developer jobs in that it will act as an aid to make developer lives easier rather than replace them. I found it interesting the amount of non-coding related overhead that goes into a software development position which the article states can be as high as 80% of the day. Having worked on small coding projects myself, Iâ€™m aware of how time-intensive coding can be so the fact that developers have to combine all the hours needed for coding as well as for non-coding tasks as well is extremely time consuming and slows down production. By utilizing AI, the article suggests that more of these non-coding tasks can be automated so that developers can spend more time coding. To me, this is exciting as it shows that we can embrace new and advanced technologies while also retaining human jobs. Additionally, since less time would be spent on non-coding tasks, there is a far greater capability for more complex software. Im interested to see what software developers are capable of when if they can spend near 100% of their working time on justing coding.
